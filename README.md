## Data

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program’s utilization. Through the team’s efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage (https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data) .

Consider there are over 20+ million records of data, I have clean and sort the data for my visualizations using data during 9/27-9/30 in 2021 and 2022 for comparasion and 9/24-9/30 in 2022 for weekly usage analysis between members and casual customers nowadays.
